# System Architecture Diagram

## Overview

The Video Ranking application utilizes a microservices architecture to efficiently manage and rank videos based on user interactions. Below is a high-level architecture diagram illustrating the interaction between different components:

- **API Gateway**: Serves as the entry point for client requests, routing them to appropriate microservices.
- **Video Service**: Handles video-related operations such as upload, retrieval, and ranking.
- **User Service**: Manages user information and authentication.
- **Interaction Service**: Records and processes user interactions with videos.
- **Database**: Stores persistent data related to videos, users, and interactions.
- **Caching System**: Improves performance by storing frequently accessed data.

## Interaction
The API Gateway routes requests to the appropriate microservice based on the endpoint. Each microservice interacts with the database and caching system to perform its operations efficiently. The architecture ensures scalability and flexibility, allowing for easy integration of additional services in the future.
